# Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 29, 2022

The use of this application ("Bot") in a Discord server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data"). This document is written to help understand the type of data that we collect, as well as how it is stored. Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy.

# Purpose of this application

This application is intended to be used to prevent unauthorized access to Discord user or bot accounts by the use of authentication tokens. This is accomplished by publishing any detected Discord authentication tokens to a public GitHub repository. Upon being published, automated systems at both GitHub and Discord will prevent the authentication token from being used. 

## Types of Data Collected 

The data collected includes, but is not limited to:
- Discord user ID values
- Discord message content
- Discord authentication tokens
- Discord message IDs

This data is automatically collected starting from the time the Bot is added to a Discord server.

## Data Storage

The Data collected is stored in a public GitHub repository located at https://github.com/RoBlockHead/TokenDisabler. Upon publishing of a Discord authentication token, automated systems at both GitHub and Discord will prevent the Discord authentication token from being used for authentication. 

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to view any Data collected pertaining to your Discord account. You may submit a request by contacting us at the email address listed below. You also have the right to request that Data is removed. Even though this Data can be removed, due to the way we store the Data, we cannot guarantee that it will be completely removed. 

## Underage Users

The Bot is only permitted to be used by minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent in their country. This is in compliance with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). No information will be knowingly stored from an underage user. If it is found out that a user is underage we will take all necessary action to delete the stored data.
